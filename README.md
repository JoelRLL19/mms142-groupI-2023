<h1>What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
<p>Augmented Reality (AR) is defined as either a real-time direct, or indirect view technology that combines digital image and information with the real-time views of the physical environment. AR bridges the digital and physical world, transforming data management and collection within the interent. While AR limits user imagination, AR simlultaneously allows the discovery of 3D worlds, and allows for simultaneous interactions between humans and machines.</p>

<h1>The Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</h1>

<p>At first glance, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality may seem the same, and easy to mix up the two, there are actually some key difference between both. The main difference being that AR uses a real world setting, and allows its user to control their presence in the real world, while in VR, it is completely virtual, and is controlled by a system. In addition, AR enchance both the virtual and real world, while VR only enchances a fictional reality.</p>
<p>In addition, Augmented Reality enchances real-life situations using both data and animations, requiring a mobile cellphone for simple usage, while Virtual Reality requires the the use of both the user's vision and hearing to cover the entire scenarion.</p>

<h1>How Does Augmented Reality Work?</h1>

<p>Ivan Sutherland, an American Computer Scientist known as the "<i>Father of Computer Graphics</i>", developed the first
augmented reality (AR) system in 1968 at Harvard. The universities, businesses, and government
organizations continued to enhance augmented reality for wearables and digital displays throughout the
ensuing decades.</p>

<p>AR delivers visual elements, sound, and other sensroy information to the user through devices like smartphones, tablets, glasses, and even contact lenses. The information is overlaid on the devices to create an interwoven 3D experience where the digital dat alters and/or improves the user's perception of the real world. AR apps are written in special 3D programs that enable developers to tie either animation, or contextual digital infromation in the program ro an augmented reality maker in the real world. When the computing device's AR app or browser plugin receives the digital information from a known marker,  it begins to execute the maker's code, and layers the correct images. Because the technology requires hardware components such as processors, sensors, displays, and input devices, mobile phones are a great example for AR usage, through its sensors including cameras, accelometers, Global Positioning System (GPS), and solid-state compasses, help make AR more accessible to users in their daily lives. For example, a GPS pinopints the user's location, and its compass detects the device's orientation.</p>

<h1>Augmented Reality as a Disruptive Technology</h1>
<h2>Defining Disruption</h2>
<p>Disruption means more than just having lots of potential, changing how a business works, and profitability (Naisby, 2018).</p>
<p>Bower and Christensen (1995) explain three key features of disruptive technologies:</p>
<p>
<p>•	These innovations may offer different qualities compared to existing solutions and may perform worse in one or two aspects that current customers of established companies value.</p>
<p>•	These innovations might not seem financially appealing to established companies.</p>
<p>•	Predicting the future market and understanding these disruptive innovations can be hard, which increases the risk and makes them less financially attractive.</p>

<h2>AR's Disruptive Potential</h2>
<p>Although Augmented Reality has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with their environment, there are several aspects where AR can potentially be
considered a disruptive technology.</p>
<p>First and foremost, AR, along with VR, allow users to experience virtual realities in ways that were previously thought impossible, such as AR glasses like Google Glass in 2013. 
Following its release, numerous companies focusing on AR glasses have emerged, offering users the ability to visualize digital objects. 
Craig (2013) states that the primary goal of AR is to "generate stimuli that make participants believe something is happening when it's not."</p>
<p>Secondly, AR allows offers new ways for its users to interact both with each other, and their envrionment through immersive processes, such as apps
like Pokemon Go, which lets players explore the real world, while the game's digital creatures are overlayed on top of the environment. Over the past few years, Android and iOS phones have been capable of running AR applications, 
and with each new iteration, they become increasingly potent due to significant investments in the technology, particularly by manufacturers like Apple (Zade, 2020).</p>
<p>Lastly, there exists Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) or projection mapping, which operates without handheld or head-mounted devices. SAR employs digital projectors to project visual content onto tangible objects.</p>

<h2>Applying Bower and Christensen's Ideas to AR</h2>
<p>Getting back to the three potential characteristics of disruptive technologies by Bower and Christensen (1995), let's relate them to Augmented Reality (AR) in a broader sense.</p>
<p>•	Different Set of Attributes</p>
<p>Considering the concept of AR, it facilitates interactive information interaction akin to real-world engagement but in a digital format. This proposition suggests novel elements, facets, and ways to generate value. 
However, these aspects are not ones that companies and consumers are accustomed to either selling or utilizing. Christensen (1997) described this as innovations that don't align with existing customer demands, 
and such disparities can readily be recognized within AR technology.</p>
<p>•	Unattractive and Uncertain Market</p>
<p>Involving innovation in markets that are hard to predict and comprehend, essentially represents innovations existing in or forming markets that are uncertain and unappealing. Implementing AR is a multi-faceted process. 
Many applications require significant resources that were previously non-existent for companies, such as hardware, content creation, and a limited understanding of its usage. These factors could limit its adoption and effectiveness. 
Essentially, several applications may require considerable investment from businesses, whether indirect costs or opportunity costs.</p>
<p>Moreover, supporting the notion of financial unattractiveness are the uncertain and modest revenue potentials outlined by Christensen (1997). This aligns with the current market scenario and major industry participants. 
The research conducted by Frodell and Olivegren (2020) highlighted that few entities derive substantial profits solely from AR applications, particularly outside the realm of entertainment. 
This underscores the challenge of developing profitable business models for companies focusing exclusively on AR.</p>
<p>In general, Augmented Reality (AR) holds significant promise for entering new markets, although it faces the tough requirement of providing accessible value propositions that are acceptable, even if not perfect, in some ways. 
AR's core revolutionary abilities to generate solutions within new dimensions will undoubtedly inspire society and drive further innovations, including sustainable ones.</p>

<h2>Issues with AR</h2>
<p>In the age of widespread technology use, the incorportation of Augmented Reality into our daily lives prompts
concerns regarding its impact on health and safety. The continious engagements with screens facilitated by AR has
the potential to contribute to various health issues, encompassing eye diseases, mental health disorders, and problems,
related to posture.</p>
<p>As individuals immerse themselves in augmented environments, there is a risk of overlooking their immediate physical
surroundings. This is particularly evident during travel, where the use of AR navigation techniques may introduce distractions, leading to misjudgments of the speed of approaching vehicles, underestimations of reaction time, and inadvertent disregard for real-world hazards.</p>
<p>The statement emphasizing that "<i>until something bad happens, you won't know you're at greater risk of harm</i>" underscores the critical need to comprehend and address the potential negative consequences of AR technology.</p>

<h1>AR Consumption Revolution</h1>

<p>In the landscape of technological advancement, the trajectory of augmented reality (AR) suggests its emergence as a mainstream medium with the potential to reshape marketing and management strategies. An intriguing question surfaces: Will AR render existing physical products and services obsolete? Philipp A. Rauschnabel's article embarks on a comprehensive exploration of AR marketing, drawing insights from four extensive studies involving over 2,000 respondents. The primary focus is to uncover consumer attitudes towards holographic AR substitutes for tangible products (Rauschnabel, 2021).</p>

<h2>Current State and Future Potential</h2>
<p>In the midst of consistent forecasts predicting AR's ascent as a mass medium, current research predominantly delves into narrow aspects of AR, such as user perceptions and responses to specific AR content. A crucial gap exists in visionary research that contemplates the broader societal and industrial implications of AR. This study takes a radical, future-oriented approach, treating AR not merely as an auxiliary tool but as a potential disruptor that could replace elements of our physical world (Rauschnabel, 2021).</p>

<h2>Systematic Analysis of Substitutability</h2>
<p>Compelling findings emerge from the research. Products, ranging from Post-it notes to manuals and navigation technology, exhibit relatively high acceptance rates for holographic AR substitution. Conversely, certain categories like pets and memorabilia display lower acceptance. The systematic analysis indicates that highly substitutable products share characteristics such as utilitarian benefits, digitization, and reduced symbolism, visibility, or ornamentation. Interestingly, expensive items do not necessarily receive higher substitution scores, challenging preconceptions and suggesting that consumers perceive AR substitutes as a distinct product category (Rauschnabel, 2021).</p>

<h2>Consumer Responses and Segment Variations</h2>
<p>A detailed examination of consumer responses reveals distinct patterns. Demographic factors such as gender and age, as well as personal AR vision, influence openness to AR substitutes. Younger males, irrespective of financial status, demonstrate greater receptiveness. Consumers with a clear personal vision of AR's impact on their lives also display higher acceptance. Additionally, those inclined towards digital substitutes, exemplified by a preference for e-books over physical books, express greater openness to AR substitutes (Rauschnabel, 2021).</p>

<h2>AR's Role in Shaping Future Experiences</h2>
<p>As the world stands on the brink of potential mass AR adoption, the article considers the transformative role of AR in shaping future consumer experiences. Rather than a mere communication gimmick, AR emerges as a potent disruptor that challenges the dichotomy between physical and virtual realms. Leading IT companies' announcements regarding technologies capable of offering realistic substitutes underscore the imminent nature of this transformative shift (Rauschnabel, 2021).</p>

<h2>Will AR render existing physical products and services obsolete?</h2>
<p>While a definitive answer to whether AR will dominate the real world remains elusive, consumer openness to transformative developments is evident. AR's potential to virtualize various physical goods marks a paradigm shift akin to the first digital revolution's digitization of information. Academics and managers are urged to view AR not just as a communication tool but as a potential disruptor with far-reaching implications.</p>

<h1>Examples of Augmented Reality In Use</h1>
<h2>Transforming Consumer Choices and Business Sales</h2>
<p>The usage of AR is getting wider and wider. Businesses such as Ikea and L'oreal, use augmented reality to help consumers
make a decision about buying their products and, at the same time, boost businesses’ sales. The business can
decrease return rates and increase customer satisfaction by enabling users to test out a significant purchase
using augmented reality.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="AR Images/ar business.JPG" width="400" height="250"></p>

<h2>Military Usage</h2>
<p>Because warfare is continious, and constantly evolving, armies have to keep up with the newest military "trends" and look for opportunities to be ahead in the technological war. AR usage in military has grown exponentionally due to data and graphics processng advance,emts, enhancing combat skills through simulation of vehicles, soldiers, and combat environments,</p>

•	Tactical Augmented Reality (TAR)
  <p>The United States Army uses TAR to improve situational awareness. All crucial imformation like spatial orientation data, weapons target are being superimposes onto the pilot's visor ro avoic looking down on their panels, having a much better assessment of their situations and surroundings. In a way, TAR looks similar to the night-vision goggles (NVG) that offers the same features.</p>
  <p>TAR operates both night and day, and can show soldiers their exact location as well the positions of both allied and enemy forces. TAR's display can also be split into two - one for aiming, and the second for from the frontal camera mounted on the helmet, to avoid the rick of a headshor. Moreover, TAR keeps soldiers both informed and aler because of its own wireless network, allowing soldiers to share information among either squad members, or inputting data whenever the situation changes.</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="AR Images/tar.JPG" width="400" height="250"></p>

<h2>Enhancing Patient Care</h2>
<p>In medicine, the AR is used to help with patient care and surgical planning and
explain difficult medical conditions to patients. The anatomy of surgical patients can be studied using AR.
They can input their MRI and CT scan results into an augmented reality headset. The procedure will aid
doctors in visualizing interior organs, bones, and muscles.</p>

<p>While in Healthcare, AR has become an increasingly integral part of it, signaling as ignificant technological intergration into the industry. The application of AR sppances various domains, including wearables, telemedicice, remote surgery, and mecial diagnosis. Enchancing patient care, streamline processes, and reducing costs is the primary objective of AR, and has shown notable advancements, showcasing its potential in the transformation of healtchcare services AR has also revolutionized both remote surgery and medical diagnosis by providing enchanced visualizations, precision, and interactive information overlay, enhacncing the surgeons' ability to interpret complex patient data.</p>

<p>In the medical studies and training in dentistry, particularly in oral and maxillofacial surgery, AR technology focuses on implants and orthoganic surgery, improving restorative dentistry, orthodontics, and endodontics.</p>

<p align="center">

<h2>Augmented Reality in Education</h2>
<p>In education, AR Books incorporate elements such as images, animation, or intarctive features superimposed on to the physcial pages when viewed from a device, such as a smartphone or tablet. According to a study on fourth and fitth-grade students founf that reading AR books increased attention, confidence, and satisfaction, highlighting the importance of providing a multisensory and interactive narrative for a better reading motivation.</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="AR Images/ar school.JPG" width="400" height="250">
</p> 

<h2>Support for People with Disability</h2>
<p>Millions of individuals worldwide, including both children and adults facing significant communication challenges relies on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. These systems, which encompass visual aids, 
offer a way for them to engage with the world. These communication tools play a crucial role in facilitating social interactions, communication, education, and work engagement, especially for individuals with neurodevelopmental 
disabilities.</p>
<p>Kang and Chang conducted a study where they used an AR game displayed on an iPhone screen to teach three teenagers with intellectual disabilities how to perform a task on a simulated Automatic Teller Machine (ATM). 
The practice and instruction in a simulated environment resulted in positive outcomes, with all participants acquiring the necessary skills to use an ATM. The study revealed that AR proved more effective and preferable to 
participants compared to other digital or paper-based navigational aids (Bryant and Hemsley, 2022).</p>
<p>Another example is these special glasses that use augmented reality to show written words of conversations happening in real time. This could be helpful for people who can't hear well. The XRAI Glass software changes spoken words 
into text, and then it appears inside the glasses for them to read.</p>

<h2>Generates New Cultural and Touristic Experiences</h2>
<p>One significant application of augmented reality in museums is providing extra information alongside exhibits. Users can use their phones to view artworks, trigger text, a virtual guide, or an animated experience to 
appear in front of them. This way, they're not reliant on guided tours and can create their personalized visit. Museums can even add fun elements like creating an app that turns finding artworks into a game, 
similar to Pokémon Go (Blanco, 2022).</p>

https://github.com/JoelRLL19/mms142-groupI-2023/assets/151889512/f624582c-f784-4847-b37d-7d924c0a66ce

<p>In the Philippines, ManilART, the country's longest-running visual art fair is showcasing the future by focusing on "phygital" art which combines both physical and digital aspects, along with new media. 
The exhibition features works by artists like Romulo Galicano, Ramon Orlina, and Bell Sison. They're using augmented reality to bring 3D-modeled sculptures to life by placing them in real-world settings. 
This creates an "enhanced view" where the art seems to come alive beyond the confines of its frame (Ebdane, 2022).</p>
<p align="center">

<p>In the entertainment industry, AR is used in a variety of ways including enhancing live events, creating more immersive and interactive vieweing experiences for movies and TV, and creating more realistic and immersive video game experiences.</p>

•	Games
  <p>AR in games utlizes a combination of computer vision, AI, and sensor dare to bring the real workd into the gaming space, with examples including Pokemon Go, The Walking Dead: Our World, and Ingress.</p>
  <p align="center">
  <img src="AR Images/pokemon go.JPG" width="400" height="250"></p>
•	Music
  <p>In 2019, English rock band Muse used AR technology to creare an immersive live music experience during their Simulation Theory Tour. Using AR headsets, Muse was able to project interactive visual elements ontohte stage, allowing the audience to see and hear the music innovatively. AR allowed the band to create a unique and unforgettable live event, especially for their fans.</p>
  <p align="center">
  <img src="AR Images/muse ar.JPG" width="400" height="250"></p>
•	Sports
  <p>Similar to the the military, AR is used in sports for training in coaching. The Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL used AR technology to create a virtual training ground for their players, allowing the team to design both a realisic and immersive training environment, allowing their players to both practice and improve their skills more efficiently.</p>
