<h1>What is Augmented Reality?</h1>
<p>Augmented Reality is defined as either a real-time direct, or indirect view of a physical real-world environment enhanced by adding computer-generated information.
With the help of technology, digital images and information may now be
shown in the real world using augmented reality (AR). Augmented reality will become the new interface
between humans and machines, bridging the digital and physical worlds.</p>

<h1>The Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality</h1>

<p>At first glance, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality may seem the same, and easy to mix up the two, there are actually some key difference between both. The main difference being that AR uses a real world setting, and allows its user to control their presence in the real world, while in VR, it is completely virtual, and is controlled by a system. In addition, AR enchance both the virtual and real world, while VR only enchances a fictional reality.</p>

<h1>How Does Augmented Reality Work?</h1>
<p>Computer scientist, Ivan Sutherland, who is known as the "<i>Father of Computer Graphics</i>", developed the first
augmented reality (AR) system in 1968 at Harvard. The universities, businesses, and government
organizations continued to enhance augmented reality for wearables and digital displays throughout the
ensuing decades. Pokémon Go, released in 2016, is an example of augmented reality in use where players travel through the
real world while following a digital map in search of virtual creatures that appear at random. 
  
<p>In medicine, the AR is used to help with patient care and surgical planning and
explain difficult medical conditions to patients. The anatomy of surgical patients can be studied using AR.
They can input their MRI and CT scan results into an augmented reality headset. The procedure will aid
doctors in visualizing interior organs, bones, and muscles. Moreover, the augmented reality (AR) movement
is booming, and it is predicted that 2.4 billion mobile users will use AR globally by 2023, according to Shweta
Sinha research study. Another important field where this technology might shine is education. Due to AR's
ability to let teachers add gaming aspects to enhance textbook material and demonstrate virtual instances of
concepts, classroom learning can become more engaging and remarkable to student</p>

<h1>Augmented Reality as a Disruptive Technology</h1>

<p>In the age of widespread technology use, the incorportation of Augmented Reality into our daily lives prompts
concerns regarding its impact on health and safety. The continious engagements with screens facilitated by AR has
the potential to contribute to various health issues, encompassing eye diseases, mental health disorders, and problems,
related to posture.</p>

<p>As individuals immerse themselves in augmented environments, there is a risk of overlooking their immediate physical
surroundings. This is particularly evident during travel, where the use of AR navigation techniques may introduce distractions, leading to misjudgments of the speed of approaching vehicles, underestimations of reaction time, and inadvertent disregard for real-world hazards.</p>

<p>In addition, AR, along with VR, allow users to experience virtual realities in ways that were previously thought impossible, such as AR glasses allowing users
to see digital objects. Secondly, AR allows offers new ways for its users to interact both with each other, and their envrionment through immersive processes, such as apps
like Pokemon Go, which lets players explore the real world, while the game's digital creatures are overlayed on top of the environment.</p>

<p>Disruption means more than just having lots of potential, changing how a business works, and profitability (Naisby, 2018). So, businesses need to learn more about AR to handle new technologies in the market.</p>
<p>Bower and Christensen (1995) explain three key features of disruptive technologies:</p>
<p>
<p>•	These innovations may offer different qualities compared to existing solutions and may perform worse in one or two aspects that current customers of established companies value.</p>
<p>•	These innovations might not seem financially appealing to established companies.</p>
<p>•	Lastly, predicting the future market and understanding these disruptive innovations can be hard, which increases the risk and makes them less financially attractive.</p>
<p>Like Christensen's concept of disruptive innovation, Schumpeter (1934) talks about a process where innovations replace old ones that become outdated. Schumpeter refers to this process as "creative destruction."</p>
<p>Although Augmented Reality has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with their environment, there are several aspects where AR can potentially be
considered a disruptive technology.</p>
<p>First and foremost, AR, along with VR, allow users to experience virtual realities in ways that were previously thought impossible, such as AR glasses like Google Glass in 2013. 
Following its release, numerous companies focusing on AR glasses have emerged, offering users the ability to visualize digital objects. 
Craig (2013) states that the primary goal of AR is to "generate stimuli that make participants believe something is happening when it's not."</p>
<p>Secondly, AR allows offers new ways for its users to interact both with each other, and their envrionment through immersive processes, such as apps
like Pokemon Go, which lets players explore the real world, while the game's digital creatures are overlayed on top of the environment. Over the past few years, Android and iOS phones have been capable of running AR applications, 
and with each new iteration, they become increasingly potent due to significant investments in the technology, particularly by manufacturers like Apple (Zade, 2020).</p>
<p>Lastly, there exists Spatial Augmented Reality (SAR) or projection mapping, which operates without handheld or head-mounted devices. SAR employs digital projectors to project visual content onto tangible objects.</p>

<p>Now, getting back to the three potential characteristics of disruptive technologies by Bower and Christensen (1995), let's relate them to Augmented Reality (AR) in a broader sense.</p>
<p>•	Different Set of Attributes</p>
<p>Considering the concept of AR, it facilitates interactive information interaction akin to real-world engagement but in a digital format. This proposition suggests novel elements, facets, and ways to generate value. 
However, these aspects are not ones that companies and consumers are accustomed to either selling or utilizing. Christensen (1997) described this as innovations that don't align with existing customer demands, 
and such disparities can readily be recognized within AR technology.</p>
<p>•	Unattractive and Uncertain Market</p>
<p>Involving innovation in markets that are hard to predict and comprehend, essentially represents innovations existing in or forming markets that are uncertain and unappealing. Implementing AR is a multi-faceted process. 
Many applications require significant resources that were previously non-existent for companies, such as hardware, content creation, and a limited understanding of its usage. These factors could limit its adoption and effectiveness. 
Essentially, several applications may require considerable investment from businesses, whether indirect costs or opportunity costs.</p>
<p>Moreover, supporting the notion of financial unattractiveness are the uncertain and modest revenue potentials outlined by Christensen (1997). This aligns with the current market scenario and major industry participants. 
The research conducted by Frodell and Olivegren (2020) highlighted that few entities derive substantial profits solely from AR applications, particularly outside the realm of entertainment. 
This underscores the challenge of developing profitable business models for companies focusing exclusively on AR.</p>
<p>In general, Augmented Reality (AR) holds significant promise for entering new markets, although it faces the tough requirement of providing accessible value propositions that are acceptable, even if not perfect, in some ways. 
AR's core revolutionary abilities to generate solutions within new dimensions will undoubtedly inspire society and drive further innovations, including sustainable ones.</p>


<p>The statement emphasizing that "<i>until something bad happens, you won't know you're at greater risk of harm</i>" underscores the critical need to comprehend and address the potential negative consequences of AR technology.</p>

<p>On the other hand, disruption means more than just having lots of potential, changing how a business works, and profitability (Naisby, 2018). So, businesses need to learn more about AR to handle new technologies in the market.</p>

<h1>Examples of Augmented Reality In Use</h1>
<h2>Transforming Consumer Choices and Business Sales</h2>
<p>The usage of AR is getting wider and wider. Businesses such as Ikea and L'oreal, use augmented reality to help consumers
make a decision about buying their products and, at the same time, boost businesses’ sales. The business can
decrease return rates and increase customer satisfaction by enabling users to test out a significant purchase
using augmented reality.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Patient Care</h2>
<p>In medicine, the AR is used to help with patient care and surgical planning and
explain difficult medical conditions to patients. The anatomy of surgical patients can be studied using AR.
They can input their MRI and CT scan results into an augmented reality headset. The procedure will aid
doctors in visualizing interior organs, bones, and muscles.</p>


<p>While in Healthcare, AR has become an increasingly integral part of it, signaling as ignificant technological intergration into the industry. The application of AR sppances various domains, including wearables, telemedicice, remote surgery, and mecial diagnosis. Enchancing patient care, streamline processes, and reducing costs is the primary objective of AR, and has shown notable advancements, showcasing its potential in the transformation of healtchcare services AR has also revolutionized both remote surgery and medical diagnosis by providing enchanced visualizations, precision, and interactive information overlay, enhacncing the surgeons' ability to interpret complex patient data.</p>

<p>In education, AR Books incorporate elements such as images, animation, or intarctive features superimposed on to the physcial pages when viewed from a device, such as a smartphone or tablet. According to a study on fourth and fitth-grade students founf that reading AR books increased attention, confidence, and satisfaction, highlighting the importance of providing a multisensory and interactive narrative for a better reading motivation.</p>

<h2>Support for People with Disability</h2>
<p>Millions of individuals worldwide, including both children and adults facing significant communication challenges, rely on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. These systems, which encompass visual aids, 
offer a way for them to engage with the world. These communication tools play a crucial role in facilitating social interactions, communication, education, and work engagement, especially for individuals with neurodevelopmental 
disabilities.</p>
<p>Kang and Chang conducted a study where they used an AR game displayed on an iPhone screen to teach three teenagers with intellectual disabilities how to perform a task on a simulated Automatic Teller Machine (ATM). 
The practice and instruction in a simulated environment resulted in positive outcomes, with all participants acquiring the necessary skills to use an ATM. The study revealed that AR proved more effective and preferable to 
participants compared to other digital or paper-based navigational aids (Bryant and Hemsley, 2022).</p>
<p>Another example is these special glasses that use augmented reality to show written words of conversations happening in real time. This could be helpful for people who can't hear well. The XRAI Glass software changes spoken words 
into text, and then it appears inside the glasses for them to read.</p>

<h2>Generates New Cultural and Touristic Experiences</h2>
<p>One significant application of augmented reality in museums is providing extra information alongside exhibits. Users can use their phones to view artworks, trigger text, a virtual guide, or an animated experience to 
appear in front of them. This way, they're not reliant on guided tours and can create their personalized visit. Museums can even add fun elements like creating an app that turns finding artworks into a game, 
similar to Pokémon Go (Blanco, 2022).</p>

<p>In the Philippines, ManilART, the country's longest-running visual art fair is showcasing the future by focusing on "phygital" art which combines both physical and digital aspects, along with new media. 
The exhibition features works by artists like Romulo Galicano, Ramon Orlina, and Bell Sison. They're using augmented reality to bring 3D-modeled sculptures to life by placing them in real-world settings. 
This creates an "enhanced view" where the art seems to come alive beyond the confines of its frame (Ebdane, 2022).</p>
